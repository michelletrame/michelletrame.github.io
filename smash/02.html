    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>Over the course of this class, you are going to build a personal website that you can use to tell the world about yourself and whatever you are passionate about.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Take a moment to think of a couple of ideas. They can be funny or serious or anything else.</li>
    <li>Close your eyes and envision what type of person might visit your website in as much detail as possible. How will they want to interact with your site? How will you present yourself to these visitors?</li>
    <li>Ask some of the other scholars about their ideas. Also take some time to get to know them a little.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>File Structures</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You should have at least one HTML file saved on your computer. Maybe you saved it on your desktop?</li>
    <li>Make it the landing page for your personal website by naming it <code>index.html</code>.</li>
    <li>If you don't want to use an existing file, make a new file named <code>index.html</code> and make sure it has the HTML shell.</li>
    <li>We need to make a folder your website for all of your files to live in.</li>
    <li>Create a new folder on the desktop. Give the folder a name with no spaces, no punctuation or capital letters.</li>
    <li>We will save all our files for the personal website here.</li>
    <li>Create the following files in your Portfolio folder.
       <ol>
        <li>about.html</li>
        <li>resume.html</li>
        <li>projects.html</li>
        <li>contact.html</li>
       </ol>
    <li>Let's open that <code>about.html</code> file and make will be an "About Me" page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional HTML tags you can use</h3>
  <p>Check them out <a href="https://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/students/examples/2-basic-html.html" target="_blank">this page! <span class='icon'>&#x238B;</span></a></p>
 
    <h3>Exercise: About Me</h3>
  <p>Let's write an "About Me" page introducing yourself.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Correctly set up the HTML document with a head and body tag</li>
    <li>The page should have a title tag in the head</li>
    <li>Use a few "horizontal rule" delimiters or line break tags as appropriate</li>
    <li>Use at least three different sizes of header tags</li>
    <li>Use ordered and unordered lists</li>
    <li>Use some &lt;em&gt; and &lt;b&gt; tags</li>
    <li>Use some &lt;br&gt; and &lt;hr&gt; tags</li>
    <li>Include profile photos</li>
    <li>In fact, we'll need plenty of images (on your computer or on the web). Users love images!</li>
    <li>Can you figure out how to resize the images?" Use google!</li>
    <li>Link to some external websites</li>
    <li>Create a "navigation bar" to allow users to click between the landing page and the "about us" section. See below for more info on the nav structure.</li>
    <li>We need easter eggs! Have at least a few SECRET COMMENTS that visitors can only see if they view your source code!</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Some things to note:</h3>
  <img src="https://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/assets/images/links.png" alt="links">
  <p>This link tag has an attribute whose name is <b>href</b> and whose value is a url.</p>
  <p>Attributes provide additional information about an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b>, separated by an equals sign.</p>
  <pre><code class="htlm">&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" alt="This text will show up, only if the image doesn't (also good for screen readers)"&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>Image tags have an attribute named <b>src</b> whose <b>value</b> is the location of the image to be displayed.</p>
  <img src="https://michelletrame.github.io/smash/nav.png">
  <p>You can put the navigation bar at the top of your <code><body></code> section for now.
